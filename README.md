## Generating the KPI Dashboard

A Python script (`generate_kpi_dashboard.py`) is included to build `KPI_Dashboard.html` using data pulled from Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn APIs. It relies on `requests` and `jinja2`. Configure your access tokens at the top of the script and run:

```bash
python generate_kpi_dashboard.py
```

The rendered dashboard will be written to `KPI_Dashboard.html`.
