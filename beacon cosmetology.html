    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      In 2020, I was honored with the <strong>Beacon Award</strong> ‚Äî a national recognition for outstanding cosmetology students awarded by the <a href="https://www.probeauty.org/beacon-student-program/" target="_blank" class="text-pink-600 underline">Professional Beauty Association</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Beacon is an elite career program for beauty and wellness students that opens the door to once-in-a-lifetime networking, mentorship, and career acceleration. It offers access to leaders in the industry, free tickets to the prestigious NAHA Awards and Premiere Orlando, and inspirational education sessions from award-winning professionals.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      I had the privilege of learning directly from names like Michelle O'Connor, Michael DeVellis, John Mosley, Jamal Edmonds, and more. Their insight on education, identity, and creativity still inspires me today.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      I graduated from cosmetology school with advanced education in color theory, textured hair, bridal styling, and inclusive salon practices. I‚Äôm particularly proud of my work in creating comfortable, sensory-aware beauty experiences for clients with disabilities and neurodivergent needs.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Beacon doesn‚Äôt stop after the weekend ends ‚Äî students are invited to apply for travel reimbursements, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-left text-lg text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li><strong>The Andrew Gomez Dream Foundation Grant</strong> ‚Äì Up to $250 for the first 100 students to help cover hotel, travel, and meals.</li>
      <li><strong>Associated Skin Care Professionals Reimbursement</strong> ‚Äì $100 awards for 5 skincare students.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
      I was inspired by Beacon alumni like Jalia Pettis, Elizabeth Faye, and Gina Bianca ‚Äî trailblazers who took their careers global and who now mentor others in beauty, branding, and business. Their stories remind me that creativity has no ceiling.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
      Beauty has always been more than surface-level for me ‚Äî it's about empowerment, expression, and community. The Beacon experience fueled my drive to blend compassion with innovation in everything I do, whether behind the chair, online, or on stage.
